1.3 release checklist:
 * Create jobs@libsdl.org
 * Implement landscape mode for iPhone port
 * Add higher precision timers for profiling
 * Implement YUV texture support
   - in progress, software support is done, Ryan is working on OpenGL shaders
 * Implement desktop video mode change notification?
 * Add OpenGL 3.0 context support
 * Finish multiple display support
 * Open windows on display that is selected when creating a window
 * Create testing plan - becoming more and more important...
   - unit tests for each feature and combination with expected output
     and actual output comparison.
 * Public license for SDL_compat.c, tests, and SDL_main*
 * Verify mouse grab support
 * Properly handle mouse grab with Vista DPI scaling
 * Make sure the mouse is where it's supposed to be when un-grabbed
 * Plan how to handle events on foreign windows
 * Add keyboard enumeration / name query API
 * Implement NET_WM_PING and NET_WM_PID/WM_CLIENT_MACHINE (?)
   - http://standards.freedesktop.org/wm-spec/wm-spec-1.3.html#KILLINGWINDOWS
 * Add a timeout parameter for SDL_WaitEvent() (?)
   - http://lists.libsdl.org/pipermail/sdl-libsdl.org/2008-May/thread.html#65067
 * Implement key repeat at the driver level
 * Add name -> keysym and name -> scancode lookup functions
 * Fix building haptic system on win32
 * Add always on top window styles
 * Add video modes that have an alpha channel?
 * Implement SDL_RenderReadPixels() for screenshots and automated testing
 * Create extended set of (negative) error codes and have the API functions document and return them.
 * Add clipboard support (from scrap demo)
 * Add support for desktop windows?
	With Qt, I can do this by the codes as follows:

	setAttribute(Qt::WA_X11NetWmWindowTypeDesktop); 
	setWindowFlags(Qt::SplashScreen);               

	Qt::WindowFlags flags = 0;
	    flags |= Qt::FramelessWindowHint;
	    flags |= Qt::Tool;                          
	    flags |= Qt::WindowStaysOnBottomHint;

	    setWindowFlags(flags);
 * Add support for synchronizing 2D updates with vblank (bug #406)
 * Add support for real-time threads and/or adjusting thread priority?
 * Add support for querying the number of CPUs and binding threads to them?
 * Allow setting multiple icon sizes

 * Add concept of viewport to fullscreen windows
 * See why windows are being rearranged.  Is the shield window not up?
 * Make sure you can create and show a fullscreen window in one step
 * Figure out how to handle OpenGL context lost on Mac OS X (does it happen?)
 * Write automated test case for multi-draw APIs
 * Make sure you can build SDL without the renderer to slim it down a bunch
 * Implement assertion code on iPhone
 * Add __WINDOWS__ in addition to __WIN32__

 * Check 1.2 revisions:
	3554 - Need to resolve semantics for locking keys on different platforms
	4874 - Do we want screen rotation?  At what level?
	4974 - Windows file code needs to convert UTF-8 to Unicode, but we don't need to tap dance for Windows 95/98
	4484, 4485 - Verify that SDL's Windows keyboard handling works correctly
	4865 - See if this is still needed (mouse coordinate clamping)
	4866 - See if this is still needed (blocking window repositioning)

Wish list for the 1.3 development branch:
http://bugzilla.libsdl.org/

 * Add a way to register custom events
 * DirectInput joystick support needs to be implemented
 * Explicit vertical retrace wait (maybe separate from SDL_Flip?)
 * Shaped windows, windows without borders
 * Multiple display support
 * Add a timestamp to events
 * Add audio input API
 * Add modifier state to key and button events

In the jump from 1.2 to 1.3, we should change the SDL_Rect members to
int and evaluate all the rest of the datatypes.  This is the only place
we should do it though, since the 1.2 series should not break binary
compatibility in this way.

Requests:
 * PCM volume control (deprecated, but possible)
